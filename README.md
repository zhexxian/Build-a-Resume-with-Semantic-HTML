Build a Resume with Semantic HTML
=================================

This is a project for [Thinkful Front End Web Development](https://www.thinkful.com/courses/learn-web-development-online/) course -- [Challenge: Build a Resume with Semantic HTML](https://courses.thinkful.com/gh-studentv1/project/1.2.4)

Requirements
------------

 - Use semantic HTML throughout the page. At a minimum you should use:
   `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<address>`.

 - Include a page title (aka, use a `<title>` element) and meta
   description in the head. You should include these in all public
   facing web pages you create because they help web crawlers understand
   your page and contribute to search engine optimization.

 - There should be a contact info section, with the following
   information about Sally: 	   
	 - Name
	 - Email address (make one up) as a link
	 - Phone number (make one up)
	 - A picture (feel free to choose one or use [this image of Ilana   
	   from Broad City](http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5NzE3NzU3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjg0NTQ5MDE@._V1_UX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg) as a stand in for Sally.

 - There should be a section for Sally's education, and it should list
   at least one college she attended.

 - There should be a section for Sally's employment history, and it
   should contain at least two entries. Each entry should show the
   company name, job title, dates of employment, and a short description
   of the job (for this last bit, feel free to use lorem ipsum filler
   text).
